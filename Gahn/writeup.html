            <h2>What have you done so far?</h2>
            <p>
                We have created a prototype that visualizes the differences between lungs across multiple lung
                conditions. The prototype allows users to explore the data interactively and compare the mechanical
                properties of the respiratory system in participants with different lung conditions.
            </p>
            <h2>What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?</h2>
            <p>
                The most challenging part of our project will be designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface
                that effectively communicates the differences between lungs across multiple lung conditions. We need to
                ensure that the visualization is clear, informative, and engaging for users with varying levels of
                expertise in respiratory physiology.
