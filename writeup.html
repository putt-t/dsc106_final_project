            <h2>What Have We Done So Far?</h2>
            <p>
                We have developed an interactive prototype for A Breath Apart, a web-based tool that
                visualizes how different lung conditions affect breathing patterns. Using D3.js, we created
                interactive demographic charts that allow users to explore participant data, including gender,
                asthma status, smoking history, vaping history, and age distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we designed a respiratory flow (Tidal Flow) visualization that displays inhalation and
                exhalation patterns across different groups. Users can select participants, adjust animation speed, and
                compare different conditions to better understand breathing variability. The dataset from the
                Respiratory dataset from PEEP study with expiratory occlusion provides real-world medical data for this
                analysis.
            </p>

            <h2>What Will Be the Most Challenging Part of the Project?</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges will be animation with breathing patterns and respiratory flow. Because
                breathing is a continuous, fluctuating process, so creating a visualization that is both
                realistic and animated will require lots of animated components in d3.js and handling scaling, and data
                manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another challenge is ensuring that our interface is user-friendly. Users should be able to explore
                the data without feeling overwhelmed by too many options or complex interactions. We need to find
                a balance between offering meaningful insights and maintaining a simple, engaging experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, since we are working with real medical data, we must ensure that our visualizations
                do not oversimplify or misrepresent the information.
