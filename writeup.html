            <h2>What Have We Done So Far?</h2>
            <p>
                We have developed an interactive prototype for A Breath Apart, a web-based tool that 
                visualizes how different lung conditions affect breathing patterns. Using D3.js, we created 
                interactive demographic charts that allow users to explore participant data, including gender,
                asthma status, smoking history, vaping history, and age distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we designed a respiratory flow visualization that displays inhalation and exhalation 
                patterns across different groups. Users can select participants, adjust animation speed, and compare 
                different conditions to better understand breathing variability. The dataset from the Respiratory 
                dataset from PEEP study with expiratory occlusion provides real-world medical data for this analysis.
                Our webpage is styled for readability and accessibility, featuring a responsive design that works 
                across different devices.
            </p>

            <h2>What Will Be the Most Challenging Part of the Project?</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges will be designing an intuitive and accurate representation of respiratory 
                flow using. Breathing is a continuous, fluctuating process, so creating a visualization that is both 
                realistic and easy to interpret will require careful consideration of animation speed, scaling, and 
                data handling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another challenge is ensuring that our interface is user-friendly. Users should be able to explore 
                the data without feeling overwhelmed by too many options or complex interactions. We need to strike 
                a balance between offering meaningful insights and maintaining a simple, engaging experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, since we are working with real medical data, we must ensure that our visualizations 
                do not oversimplify or misrepresent the information. We may need to refine our approach based on 
                domain expert research to maintain scientific credibility while keeping the interface approachable.
